# ML

Hey there! 🧋

This repository contains simple ML/DL experiments I make in my time of exploring Pytorch. 🔥
I hope to, by the end of the summer of 2023, be comfortable in building and familiarizing myself with the code and concepts
of --> Simple, Convolutional, Fully Convolutional NN

Some other things that interest me, and may go into this repo, are stable diffusion! 🤔

A project I hope to make some day in this regard if it's possible (probably) is a tool that takes in code and spits out an animation of it, like https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit , and suggestions on possible improvements. 😄 

For instance, take the famous Two-Sum problem from leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/ . Input an image of a quadratic time solution, and it would output the animation, as well as suggestions/hints on making it O(n), or more efficient. 

I believe this tool could be used in classrooms, students, and teachers. Needless to say, it wouldn't directly provide a solution — that would defeat the purpose of learning. But, by nudging the person towards the correct solution, it could truly help solidify foundations, challenge perspectives, and open the boundaries for learning. 🏫

If you are interested in hoppinh in, don't hesitate to reach out to me. I would love the advice/suggestions! 🎤
